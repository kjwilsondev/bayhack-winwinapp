* **concurrently**:
  * allows us to run our backend and frontend concurrently and on different ports
* **express**:
  * sits on top of Node to make the routing, request handling, and responding easier to write
* **is-empty**:
  * global function that will come in handy when we use validator
* **jsonwebtoken**:

* **mongoose**:
  * used to interact with MongoDB
* **passport**:

## Passport

### ExtractJwt Methods

For taking a JSON Web Token. This module has functions for extracting certain pieces or all of the JWT

```js
fromHeader(header_name)
```

creates a new extractor that looks for the JWT in the given http header

```js
fromBodyField(field_name)
```

creates a new extractor that looks for the JWT in the given body field. You must have a body parser configured in order to use this method.

```js
fromUrlQueryParameter(param_name)
```

creates a new extractor that looks for the JWT in the given URL query parameter.

```js
fromAuthHeaderWithScheme(auth_scheme)
```

creates a new extractor that looks for the JWT in the authorization header, expecting the scheme to match auth_scheme.

```js
fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken()
```

creates a new extractor that looks for the JWT in the authorization header with the scheme 'bearer'

```js
fromExtractors([array of extractor functions])
```

creates a new extractor using an array of extractors provided. Each extractor is attempted in order until one returns a token.
